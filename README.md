# LME Trade Request Generator

This repository contains a small web application that helps build standardized text for London Metal Exchange (LME) trade requests. It is a single page built with HTML and Tailwind CSS.
Tailwind is bundled locally as `tailwind.min.css`, so the interface works without a network connection after the first visit.

## Running the app

Because the page registers a service worker, it needs to be served over HTTP. You can use any simple static server. Examples:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000
# or using Node
npx http-server -p 8000
```

If you have installed the dependencies you can also run:

```bash
npm start
```

This uses the bundled http-server to serve the site on port 8000.

After the server starts, open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in a modern browser.
Make sure to visit the full path to `index.html` (not just `/`) because the service worker only caches that file.

### Input validation

Enter quantities as finite positive numbers. Values of zero or negative amounts
will trigger an error message.

When selecting the price type for Leg 1 you can choose **AVG Period** to specify an averaging period. Pick a start and end date in the Leg 1 section and the request text will reflect that range.

If one leg uses **Fix** pricing while the other uses **AVG**, a checkbox labeled "Use AVG PPT Date" appears next to the fixing date field on the fixed leg. When selected, this option fills that field with the averaging leg's **last business day of the month**. The generated request then omits the fixing date and uses the averaging leg's PPT (second business day of the following month) for both sides. Leg&nbsp;2's checkbox is visible when Leg&nbsp;1 is set to **AVG** and Leg&nbsp;2 is **Fix**. Likewise, Leg&nbsp;1's checkbox appears when Leg&nbsp;1 is **Fix** and Leg&nbsp;2 is **AVG**.

Only the leg priced as **Fix** shows this checkbox. When checked the generated request uses the averaging leg's PPT for that fixed leg and the fixing date does not appear in the text. If you enter a specific fixing date instead, the PPT still matches the averaging leg's PPT but the fixing date is shown before it.

The Buy/Sell options of the two legs are synchronised: selecting **Buy** on Leg
1 automatically selects **Sell** on Leg 2 and vice versa.

Selecting a company at the top of the page also adds a header to the final text
area. Depending on the choice, the first line will be either **For Alcast Brasil Account:** or **For Alcast Trading Account:**.

Fixing date inputs only appear when a leg uses **Fix** pricing (Leg&nbsp;2 also
shows it for **C2R (Cash)**). When one leg is **AVG** and the other **Fix**, checking the "Use AVG PPT Date" option automatically fills the fixed leg's date with the averaging leg's last business day.

## Execution Instruction

When a leg uses **Fix** or **C2R** pricing the app adds an *Execution Instruction* line to the final text. This line describes how to handle the order based on the selected order type.

Order types include **At Market**, **Limit**, **Range** and **Resting**. Choosing **Limit** reveals a single *Limit Price* input, **Range** shows *From* and *To* fields and **Resting** posts the order until it trades. Except for **At Market**, an **Order Validity** dropdown lets you specify how long the order remains active (Day, GTC, 3&nbsp;Hours, 6&nbsp;Hours, 12&nbsp;Hours or Until Further Notice). The validity value appears in the Execution Instruction line.

## Building

No build step is required for the web version. The repository only contains static files (`index.html`, `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `service-worker.js`). If you modify the code you simply refresh the browser to see the changes.

### Creating a desktop executable

The repository also provides a minimal [Tauri](https://tauri.app) configuration. After installing the dependencies you can build a desktop executable with:

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri:build
```

This script runs `vite build` to output the web assets under `dist/` before
packaging the application with Tauri.

The resulting binary will appear under `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/` for your platform.

## Service worker

`service-worker.js` caches the essential files (`index.html`, `main.js`, `calendar-utils.js`, `holidays.json`, `solarlunar.min.js`, `tailwind.min.css` and the service worker itself) when the app is installed. This lets the app continue working offline after the first visit.

`holidays.json` was added in cache version 6 so holiday data is available offline.

The worker uses a `CACHE_VERSION` constant to build a cache name (`lme-cache-v<version>`). Increment this value during a release so clients fetch the updated files. The activation step deletes any caches that don't match this name. During installation it also verifies that all core files were cached successfully.

After increasing `CACHE_VERSION`, refresh the site so the new worker can take control and clear the previous cache.

## Holiday data

Holiday dates are stored in `holidays.json`. When the page loads it fetches the
latest data from the [GOV.UK Bank Holidays API](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays.json) and merges the result with the local file so the app keeps working offline.

Run the following command whenever you want to refresh `holidays.json`:

```bash
npm run update-holidays
```

This command downloads the latest dates from the GOV.UK service, so make sure
you are connected to the internet when running it.

## Prerequisites

- A modern browser that supports service workers.
- Any local HTTP server (Python 3, Node.js, etc.) if you want to run it locally.
- Node.js 18 or later.

## Running tests

Run `npm install` once to fetch the dependencies and then execute the suite with `npm test`:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```
